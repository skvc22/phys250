    "\n",
    "A notebook is a complete document; it includes both documentation and code in a single file. Writing good, clear documentation is an important step in solving a problem. Here and in the lab we will get some practice in documenting our code. Rich, nicely formatted documentation is provided in the notebook through the use of LaTeX and `Markdown`. We will expand our knowledge of LaTeX and get an introduction to `Markdown` in this prelab.\n",

However, most of the important aspects of LaTeX have been implemented, though not every example you may find online will work.\n",

    "Technical writing follows most of the rules you have learned for writing papers in other classes. One issue you have may not have encountered is how to deal with mathematical expressions and equations. In general these should be treated just like all other parts of speech. They should flow nicely in your discourse and should be punctuated as any other part of speech. The examples, prelabs, labs, and homework should serve as examples of how to include equations in documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will cover a few other aspects of LaTeX. In general, LaTeX commands are preceded by a backslash ('`\\`'). Many commands can be \"guessed\" by using this rule. Also recall that text that is to be typeset by LaTeX is surrounding by dollar characters (`$`). Finally, remember that any `Markdown` cell can be viewed by double clicking on the cell or hitting `Enter` while the cell is selected. This can be used to see how all the cells in this and other documents have been written to get the formatted text you see."

    "So far we have been talking about inlined equations, that is, small equations that appear within a sentence. We can also set equations apart in what is called display style. This is useful for larger or more important equations. To write an equation in display style we surround it by double dollar characters (`$$`) instead of single ones.

If we have many nested delimiters or particularly large expressions inside such delimiters then using the normal sized versions would look bad. LaTeX will automatically scale delimiters when they are used with the `\\left` and `\\right` commands. Note that every `\\left` **must** have an accompanying `\\right`, though the delimiter following the `\\left` need not be the same as that following the `\\right`. As one example a part of an equation from Lab 2 can be written as\n",

Documentation is also available from the `Help` menu above which takes you to a page that describes the differences between `Markdown` as implemented in the notebook (which is \"github flavored\") and standard `Markdown`.

Embedding test cases in your notebook is the best way to ensure that any future changes, no matter how trivial you think they are, do not introduce errors. Here we will explore embedding tests in a very simple way, using `assert`. There are other methods for doing this, including whole test suite creation mechanisms often used in larger projects. We will stick with the simplest method here.\n",
